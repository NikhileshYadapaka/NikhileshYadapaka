### Hello! I'm Nikhilesh Yadavaka üëã

I'm a Data Analyst passionate about uncovering insights from data to drive informed business decisions. I have a strong foundation in statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning, with hands-on experience in extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data. I'm proficient in using a variety of tools and technologies to analyze and interpret complex datasets.

### üõ†Ô∏è Skills

Here's a breakdown of my technical skills:

* **Programming Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI, Excel (including PivotTables, Charts)
* **Machine Learning:** Regression, Classification, Clustering, Model Evaluation, Scikit-learn
* **Databases:** SQL 
* **Data Analysis Tools:** Excel, Google Sheets
* **Statistical Analysis:** Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA, Statistical Modeling
* **ETL:** Data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.


### üíº Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

* **Customer Churn Analysis (Python):** Developed a predictive model using Python and Scikit-learn to identify customers at risk of churn, enabling proactive retention strategies. This project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection (Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and model evaluation (using metrics like precision, recall, and AUC-ROC).
* **Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI):** Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize sales trends, identify top-performing products, and track key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard included drill-down capabilities, filters, and visualizations to provide actionable insights to the sales team.
* **SQL Data Analysis for E-commerce (SQL):** Conducted in-depth analysis of e-commerce data using SQL to optimize inventory management, analyze customer behavior, and improve marketing campaign effectiveness. This involved writing complex SQL queries to extract and aggregate data from multiple tables.
* **Marketing Campaign Analysis (Excel):** Used Excel to analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, including calculating ROI, analyzing customer segmentation, and creating visualizations to communicate findings. This project utilized PivotTables, VLOOKUP, and other Excel functions.
* **Housing Price Prediction (Python):** Built a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features, such as location, size, and amenities.

### üå± Currently Learning

I'm currently expanding my knowledge in the following areas:

* Advanced Machine Learning Techniques (e.g., Deep Learning, Time Series Analysis)
* Big Data Technologies (e.g., Spark, Hadoop)
* Cloud Computing (e.g., Azure Data Services, AWS)
